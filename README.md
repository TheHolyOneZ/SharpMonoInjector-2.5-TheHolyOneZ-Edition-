# SharpMonoInjector TheHolyOneZ Edition v2.7

A **modern, fully-featured Mono assembly injector** with **advanced stealth injection**, **real-time logging**, **profile management**, **Thunderstore and r2modman auto-detection**, and **smart injection routing** for both **standard BepInEx** and **mod manager environments**.

This release builds on **v2.6**, introducing the new **Smart Injection Router**, **Receiver Auto-Detection**, and **Thunderstore integration**, making SharpMonoInjector easier to use than ever before.

## üß≠ Overview

**SharpMonoInjector** allows safe injection of managed assemblies into Mono-embedded applications (commonly Unity Engine games) without restarting the target process. This is ideal for runtime modding, plugin debugging, or live patching.

Now fully compatible with **BepInEx**, **Thunderstore Mod Manager**, and **r2modman** setups.

---

## üÜï What's New in v2.7 (Latest Release)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Injection Router (NEW)

Automatically detects where BepInEx or Thunderstore profiles are located and injects accordingly ‚Äî no manual path setup needed.

**Detection Priority:**

1. Standard BepInEx in game directory
2. Thunderstore profile under `%AppData%\\Thunderstore Mod Manager`
3. r2modman profile under `%AppData%\\r2modman`

**Status Messages:**

* `Injecting via BepInEx Receiver...` ‚Üí Standard setup detected ‚úÖ
* `Injecting via Thunderstore BepInEx...` ‚Üí Thunderstore/r2modman detected ‚úÖ
* `BepInEx detected! Receiver plugin required.` ‚Üí Receiver missing ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üß© Receiver Auto-Detection

The injector automatically looks for `SharpMonoInjectorTheHolyOneZEdition.dll` under any of these valid plugin locations:

```
GameFolder\\BepInEx\\plugins\\
AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderstore Mod Manager\\DataFolder\\<GameName>\\profiles\\Default\\BepInEx\\plugins\\
AppData\\Roaming\\r2modman\\profiles\\<GameName>\\BepInEx\\plugins\\
```

No need for manual file placement ‚Äî the router finds it automatically.

### üíâ Safe Double Injection (Improved)

The Receiver now performs an internal two-phase injection to prevent Unity/Photon crashes and ensure stable DLL loading. Logs clearly indicate both passes.

### ü™Ñ Quality of Life

* Smart Router remembers last successful injection path per game.
* Added **Receiver Ping Test** button to verify communication before injection.
* Enhanced error recovery when receiver pipe isn‚Äôt found.
* Rewritten detection logic for Thunderstore profiles (now scans correctly under AppData).

## üîå SharpMonoInjector Receiver Plugin v2.7

A companion **BepInEx plugin** that safely receives injections from SharpMonoInjector and handles them internally via named pipes.

### üì¶ Installation

#### **If Using Thunderstore or r2modman (Recommended)**

Simply drag the receiver DLL here:

```
AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderstore Mod Manager\\DataFolder\\<GameName>\\profiles\\Default\\BepInEx\\plugins\\SharpMonoInjectorTheHolyOneZEdition.dll
```

> Works even if not in a subfolder ‚Äì BepInEx still loads it automatically.

#### **If Using Standard BepInEx Installation**

```
YourGameFolder\\BepInEx\\plugins\\SharpMonoInjectorTheHolyOneZEdition.dll
```

---

### üîß How It Works

**Communication:** Named Pipe ‚Üí `SharpMonoInjectorPipe_THOZE`

**What It Does:**

1. Waits for injection requests from SharpMonoInjector.
2. Blocks problematic components (like PhotonView) that crash on injection.
3. Safely loads DLLs in a BepInEx-compatible way.
4. Performs automatic double-injection to ensure success.

**Logs:**

* `GameFolder/SmiReceiverLog.txt` ‚Äì Injection receiver logs
* `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` ‚Äì BepInEx system logs

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Open **SharpMonoInjector v2.7 TheHolyOneZ Edition**.
2. Select your target game process.
3. Choose your DLL, namespace, class, and method.
4. Click **Inject** once.
5. Watch the log ‚Äî router selects the right injection path automatically.

**Successful Status Example:**

```
[SmartRouter] Thunderstore BepInEx detected
[Pipe] Connected successfully
[Double Injection Complete]
```

---

## üß† Troubleshooting

### "Connection timed out"

* Ensure the game is running.
* Check the Receiver plugin is installed in one of the listed plugin paths.
* Restart the game.

### "Receiver not found"

* Plugin is missing or placed in the wrong BepInEx profile.
* Verify both BepInEx and the Receiver loaded successfully in `LogOutput.log`.

### "BepInEx detected! Receiver plugin required."

* BepInEx found, but receiver not loaded.
* Install the DLL to the `BepInEx/plugins/` directory for your environment.

### Still Crashes?

* Check `SmiReceiverLog.txt` and `LogOutput.log`.
* Look for these success indicators:

  * `[BLOCKED] PhotonView` ‚Üí protection active ‚úÖ
  * `Double injection complete!` ‚Üí success ‚úÖ
